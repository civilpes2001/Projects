What tool did they use to determine the mass.\\n1674,1,0,3,average,worst,\"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar they used, how much distilled water to rinse the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each sample.\"\\n1675,1,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"In order to replicate their experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into each of the containers as well as what kind of samples we are going to measure. It should state specifically marble, limestone, wood and plastic. It should also tell us on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results. The last thing that would be needed to replicate this experiment is to tell us what kind of containers the samples should be put in such as wooden boxes,glass test tubes,ziploc bags etc.\"\\n1676,1,0,3,worst,worst,Pleace a simple of one material into one container and label it. Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container.\\n1677,1,0,3,worst,worst,\"Determin the mass of four different samples marble, limestone, wood, plastic. They all have starting mass and end mass, and the diffrence. The wood has the most mass but marble has the most diffrence in mass.\"\\n1678,1,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"In order to repeat the experiment you would need to know what you are testing for. They never say the reason for the experiment you need to know how much vinegar they used, because that should be the same for each container. Also in their procedure they dont tell what the samples aren\\'t. If you only had the procedure and not the graph, you wouldnt be able to replicate is because you dont know what they were testing in the vinegar.\"\\n1679,1,0,3,worst,worst,To replicate this experiment you would need four new samples. You would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment in.\\n1680,1,0,3,worst,worst,\"After reading the procedure, there is a lot more information that they need in order to replicate this experiment. They should say how much vinegar to put into the container and which container to put it in. They should be more specific when stating how things should be measured by saying \\'measure mass on a tripple-beam balance\"\" etc.\"\\n1681,1,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"After reading the group\\'s procedures, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container. This important because  it could affect  how much of the sample is dissolved. I would also need to know were to store the containers in a cold or hot room with light or dark. Also I would need to know the formula for finding the difference incase I didn\\'t know. It is a common error to subtract the wrong masses. Finally, I would need to know how long to rinse each sample and whether to dry the samples under light or not.This would affect its weight.\"\\n1682,1,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the names of the three samples being tested in the experiment. The amount of the sample being poured into the containers would also be necessary as well as the amount of distilled water being used to rinse each sample. Another important factor would be to know the location of samples were placed in to sit and dry for 30 minutes. How the students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate the experiment.\"\\n1683,1,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"In order to replicate this experiment I would need to determine the mass and then label each of the four containers. I would also need to put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last additional changes I would do is to clean up, gather my materials first, and then determine which material is right for solving my problem.\"\\n1684,1,0,3,average,worst,What the hypothesis is/what they are trying to prove. How much vinegar is needed and added to each sample. What can be used as a constant?\\n1685,1,0,3,average,worst,\"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I conclude, that they need for me to replicate the experiment is, where do you put the samples when you replace them from the containers and how to determine the mass.\"\\n1686,1,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"To replicate the group\\'s experiment, the procedure would have to state how much vinegar was poured into the containers. Also, they should specify what kinds of containers they were using as this could affect the results. In the procedure, they also failed to tell what 4 samples were used in the experiment, a key variable to it\\'s success.\"\\n1687,1,0,3,average,worst,\"Some information that I would need to replicate the experiment are a list of the materials Id need to know how to determine the mass, because those things are not stated in the procedure.\"\\n1688,1,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"To replicate this experiment the person would need to state how much vinegar to use, how they re going to determine the mass of the end and how long to rinse of the samples with water.\"\\n1689,1,0,3,excellent,average,\"Information that would be required to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample of material, and where to store the sample when they are drying from the vinegar.\"\\n1690,1,0,3,average,worst,The student should have stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not. Also they should have added what could\\'ve went wrong in the experiment and what should they have worked on to make better.\\n1691,1,0,3,average,worst,\"In the procedure, there is not enough information for someone to replicate this experiment. The procedure should include namingine four samples that need to be determined and how much vinegar needs to be poured in the containers. The students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass. These three things could improve the procedure of the experiment.\"\\n1692,1,0,3,above_average,above_average,One piece of information that I would add is how much vinigar to use in each container. The 2nd piece I would add is how big the container should be. A third piece of information that I would add to this experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table.\\n1693,1,0,3,average,worst,\"For me to be able to replicate this experiment, i would just have to follow the procedure over again.For example, i would have to determine the mass of all four samples. Next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separate containers and act.\"\\n1694,1,0,3,average,worst,\"Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is you would need to know the data collected from before. Another thing you would need is to know the collected information, on last and final thing you would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for 30 mins.

I would also need to have stated in the procedure to calculate the difference in mass.\"\\n2228,1,0,3,average,worst,\"In order to replicate this experiment, the procedure would need to be rewritten with more detail. First, a step to record the mass of 4 samples before placing them in vinegar would need to be added. Next, the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be in each container. Another step they did not add was to re-label the samples after they are removed from vinegar, in order to tell them a part from each other.\"\\n2229,1,0,3,excellent,average,After reading the groups procedure i would conclude that i will add a independent variable to the lab. Also i would want to place the containers in a constant temperature area for more accurate testing.\\n4066,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B has the largest amount stretched. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental decison is by allowing the weights to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more. Another way he could have improved his experiment is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct.\\n4067,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,A. Sample B plastic has the most stretchability. B. One way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched. Another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on.\\n4068,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,The stretchiest plastic was plastic B in both trials.

Also the student should specify how much weight is on the clamp.\\n4071,2,0,3,average,worst,\"A.) Based on the data of the table, I conclude that plastic B was the most stretchable. In both trials it proved to be always above 20mm. ^P B.) The student could\\'ve used different clamps in his trials, this would\\'ve expanded the student possibilities with the plastics. To help with the validity, the student could explain what he did different. For trial T2, for the measures are not the same as T1 except for plastic type D, in both trials the measures were the same.\"\\n4072,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic B was the strongest. Plastic B was the strongest because in trial one it stretched the most to 22mm. Ther trial two B stretched to 23mm.

In the procedure the student should have stated labels that she/he was measuring in.\\n4073,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"A conclusion that can be dawn from the students experiment is that plastic B is able to stretch the farthest (T1:22mm, T2:23mm) and plastic A stretched the least (T1:10mm, T2:12mm). The validity of this experiment could have been improved greatly by doing these two things; 1) Making sure that the starting length of the plastics were all the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic will be stretched to the table at the beginning. By doing these two things, you\\'re ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment\"\\n4074,2,0,3,average,worst,B. Two ways the students could improve the experiment is to doing it again and again until you get the same results. Another way could to leave the plastics hanging for longer.\\n4075,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type A which in T1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment.\"\\n4076,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"a. Based on the data, the strectchiest polymer plastic of the four is plastic type B, because in the both trials, it stretched the most (22 and 23 mm). ^p b. 1.) Add more trials to increase accuracy of the results. 2.) Repeat the experiment with heavier weights to see if it affects the results.\"\\n4077,2,0,3,average,worst,a) The only type of plastic that appears to make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type D. ^p b) They could have improved their design/validity by telling us exactly how much they measured in procedure 1. Another would be they could do a 3rd trial.\\n4078,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable of all the plastic types. Type D was a close second. Plastic type A and C are not very stretchy. ^p b. To improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results.\"\\n4079,2,0,3,worst,worst,Thus for our experimentation our data has proved in conclusion that plastic type B and D recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. One way the students could have improved the data is by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way being how students could have improved their data is by telling the amount of weights added for stretching.\\n4080,2,0,3,excellent,average,a. Plastic Type B stretched the farthest in both trials. Type D stretched second farthest in each trial and C and A stretched the third and least farthest respectively. The order of each plastic type\\'s stretchiness remained the same in both trials. ^p b. The student could have done more trials. They also could\\'ve used more specific types.\\n4081,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"In conclusion this is what the plastic did in the first try and this is what happened in the second try. The best plastic is plastic B because it hangs longer than the other. ^p To make it better is hang it for 7 minutes. maybe put something else than weight, I think scissors.\"\\n4082,2,0,3,above_average,average,a) Plastic D is the best type of plastic because it\\'s the most stretchable unlike type A which is the least stretchable.^p b.) Do another trial and add heavier weights.\\n4083,2,0,3,average,worst,Trial 2 was the most stretched plastic because after stretching them a couple of times then they set loose and stretchier than the first time. The most stretchiest was plastic B it has the most stretch than the others. ^p The student could\\'ve kept it hanging maybe a little bit longer.\\n4084,2,0,3,average,worst,\"3. Based on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics. Instead of putting it attached to the table, it could be stretched over a cup. By doing this it will hold more weight, and they will get more acurate answers.\"\\n4085,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"A) When dealing with different types of plastic to find out their strechability, I found that plastic type A that 1 had the least amount of stretchability, with only 10mm, whereas plastic type B, trial two out measured A, C, and D\\'s stretchability with 25mm!^p B) 1.

They also could have added on more weight over a period of time.\"\\n4088,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"There is only two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is by telling the day or hour of the experiment, and see if the student\\'s hypothesis was correct or not.\"\\n4089,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"The students that could of have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results its make sure all their supplies are there put the data table in order, and follow the time as instructed.\"\\n4090,2,0,3,above_average,average,(A) Plastic type B was the superior in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p (B) Record the weight that was put on to show how much effected each plastic.

Plastic B stretch the farthest, plastic A stretched the lowest. You can conclude that plastic B was the better plastic for the polymer investigation. ^p 1 Way) student could have changed or tested the different plastics at different times. (way 2) Remove the weight from 2 plastics and leave the other 2 with to see the outcome difference.\"\\n4093,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest making it the weakest type of plastic. However, plastic type A stretched the least, making it the stordest. b) 1.The student should have had atleast one more trial for completely accurate results. 2. The student should have more specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic.\"\\n4094,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"A conclusion that I can draw from this data is that plastic type B, stretched the most on both trials (22, 23mm). Two things that could be improved in this experiment are that a third or more trials could be performed, and also the amount of weight put on should be monitored, and controlled.\"\\n4095,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,a) Polymer plastic type B has the highest stretchability. It had 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. None of the other types of plastics stretched further than 20mm on either trial. ^p b) The student could have tested more types of plastic or made more trials to improve the experiment.\\n4096,2,0,3,average,worst,I concluded that plastics A and B strech the most. One way the students could have improved the design is by stating how much weight they were adding. Another way is if they recorded a control for validity.\\n4097,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"A. Based on the data plastic D isn\\'t very stretchy because it was the same length in both trials. It didn\\'t vary by even an inch. Plastic B must be stretchy because it stretched the largest in both trials. B. They could have included more trials they could have at in included the original length of the plastics (before being stretched) so you could compare \"\"see how much each one stretched.\"\\n4098,2,0,3,average,worst,3. a) Plastic type A stretched the most C. b) They could of had more trials and used more types of plastic.\\n4099,2,0,3,average,worst,For the conclusion it wasn\\'t a big difference from the (T1) and (T2). It was more like 1 or 2 amount stretched from the first trial we did the procedure 2 times and have got different things most of the time.^p They could have had an empty plastic cup hanging from the plastic type to see it there was much difference. The could have also don a third trial just to see if there was much difference.\\n4100,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"The group can conclude that plastic type B, is the most effective type of plastic. According to the table, Plastic type B held 22mm in trial 1, and 23mm in trial 2. That was the best closely followed by the type D with 20mm, and 20mm. In the experiment, the group could have done 1 more trial to really reinforce the results. Along with that being said, the group also should have measured the weight of the weights, and kept the weight constant for more valid results.\"\\n4101,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,A) Our expirament was successful. Some of the plastic that we stretched out increase during trial 2. ^p B) They could have told us how long or wide the plastic has to be and how to rap if to the table.\\n4102,2,0,3,average,worst,\"Based on the student\\'s test, plastic type B is the best. Plastic type B has the highest stretchability in both test. The students could\\'ve improved their expirements by adding weights till the plastic broke & performing a different test in trail 2.\"\\n4103,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"a) I can conclude based on the students data, that plastic type B was the most stretchable. And plastic type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was be, first of all, describing what kind of tape was used because simple, weakest tape would probably, not work in this situation. The best kind of tape might be duct tape, scratch tape, or measuring tape. So that needs to be specified. Also, the student should have told us the exact amount of weight that should be used for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive. The design needs to be more specific.\"\\n4104,2,0,3,average,worst,\"The plastic type A, B increases except plastic C & D. Plastic A increase from 10 mm to 12mm, plastic B increases from 22mm to 23 mm, plastic D stayed the same 20mm, 20mm, plastic  C decrease from 14 mm to 13 mm. ^p One way to improve this experiment is to allow them to hang for more time , Another way is to run more than two trials.\"\\n4105,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"A) Based on the conclusion of the students data they took 4 pieces of plastic taped them to an edge of adesk, claped wieghts to them and let them hang for 5 minutes. Then measured them to see how long they have stretched. They did this twice for all four types of plastics. So they got two results for all of the plastics. B) Two ways the students could of improved their experimental design are one had at, the same amount of weight on the different types of plastics. Also they could of had more trials so they could of had more results.\"\\n4106,2,0,3,average,worst,\"a) A conclusion i can make base on this data is that all the specific plastic types had very different effects by either growing, shrinking, or staying the same.^p (b)Two ways the student could have proved the experiment is to include where exactly this experiment is taking place and also the durability of the table being used.\"\\n4107,2,0,3,worst,worst,I conclude that plastic type A has the most stretchability because from T1 to T2 it stretched two more mm and the rest did not stretch as much as type A. One way this student could have improved the experiment design is by ofsonbing how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sample should weigh. Another improvent needs to be in step 5. The student needs to specify what kind of weights are needed and how heavy.\\n4108,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"The different plastic type stretched different A. plastic A in the T1 they stretched less the the T2 in the plastic B in the trial 2 they stretched one mm that the trial C the trial, they stretched more than the trial 2. D they are equal.^p B. The two ways the student could have improved to the experimental design or validity of the results is add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes the other is and then measure the length of the plastic types.\"\\n4109,2,0,3,excellent,average,The student could have impoved this by being more specific for example the could say how long the piece of plastic is how much weight is being added to the plastic and to also shoe the type being used.\\n4110,2,0,3,average,worst,\"Based on the data i can see that not all of the types of plastic stretched, one type of plastic got smaller and one type stood the same. One way that the student could have improved the experiment is by explaining what the four types of plastic were. And second they could have drawn a graph to show the difference of the plastic before and after.\"\\n4111,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,Based on the data one can conclude that plastic type B has the highest stretchability because its average amount stretched is greater than any other types. ^P Two ways that the student could\\'ve improved the validity of the results would be to cut all out polymers to the same length and to add the same amount of weight to every polymer.\\n4112,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"The polymer plastic type A & B were stretch 2mm more after trial 2. Plastic type C & D  obviously is a totally different type of polymer plastic which is not easy to stretch. Plastic type \"\"C\"\" decrease 1 mm while plastic type \"\"D\"\" stayed the same. They could of improved there validity by mentioning how many weights they used for each trial & also stating the different type of polymer plastics.\"\\n4113,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"A) Plastic B has stretched out the furthest more than any other plastic I have tested. The least stretched plastic is plastic type A which was at 10 for T1 and 12 for T2. Type B stretched to 22 in T1 and 23 in T2 at the most stretchability. Type C was at 14 for T1 and 13 for T2. Lastly, type D was at type 20mm for T1 and T2 at 20. The students improved by starting to find out which polymer had the most stretchability. B) One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add a control with all polymers plastic with stretching it out. Another to improve is to add more for starts such as same starting length of all plastics, same weight, same surface area.\"\\n4114,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,Based on the data plastic B stretched the most out of all the plastics. So plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic out of the four plastics. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it only stretche10-12mm and plastic B stretched 22-23mm. The students should have stated how much weight was more used and if they used the same amount of weights for each plastic. Also the plastics should all start out the same length to ensure validity.\\n4115,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength because it stretched the farthest in both trials, and plastic type A has the least tensile strength, because it stretched the least in both trials. ^p b) The students could have indicated how many millimeters of plastic should be taped on top of the table, and indicated how heavy each weight should be.\"\\n4116,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,The conclution would be that plastic type D has streched the most and that plastic type A had streched the least. One way the student could have improved the experement would be to tell people the mass of the weights used. Another thing the student could have done was to list the starting length of the plastic in his data table.\\n4117,2,0,3,average,worst,\"A conclusion based on the students data is \"\"B\"\" and \"\"D\"\" were measured out to be in the low both. \"\"A\"\" and \"\"C\"\" were measured in the laend. One way they could of improved the design is meseric the length of tin plastic before they added weight B. A second way they could improve this design is tell us in the procedure when to measure after adding the weights on.\"\\n4118,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"In the polymer investigation four different polymer plastics were tested for their stretchability. In this experiment, plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type A stretched the least. The results are reliable because of the two trials the amount stretched only different by 2 mm or the most, disrupting our consistency in the experiment. To improve this experiment, I would run a third and fourth trial to develop an average amount stretched for each plastic type. Additionally, I would make the length of each plastic type the same for a better comparison of each plastics amount stretched.\"\\n4119,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"My conclusion would be that plastic A would be the most resistant plastic and plastic plastic B would be the stretchiest plastic . One way the student could have improved the validity of the results could have been to run more trials for the samples of plastic. One way to improve the experimentol design would be to change step 6\"\" to repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining three plastic samples\\'\\', this would couse less confusion for people doing this procedure.\"\\n4120,2,0,3,above_average,average,A) Based on the student data I conclude that plastic type B was the stretchiest of all plastics because in both trial 1 and 2 it got higher than 20 both times which was higher for any other plastic. ^P B) The student could have improved this experiment by having a constant amount of weight as put on all the plastics and he should have had a control group.\\n4121,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"The experiment shows that plastic type B has the most tensile strength, since it would have done to improve the experiment are to specify the amount of weight  added and give specific starting length for each plastic, perfeably the same length for each.\"\\n4122,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,Freom this experiment we can conclude that plastic type B stretched the farthest when weights were added to the pull of gravity. They could improve the experiment by saying how many weighs should be added to the plastic to keep it constant. Also they could add more trials to increase the validity.\\n4123,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"A. Based on the results of the experiment, I believe that plastic C will take the most weight. All the other plastics either extended when more weight was added or stayed the same. Plastic C though actually shrunk in size unlike plastic A which went from 10 to 12 and B which went from 22-23 mm and lastly D witch remained at 20 mm the whole duration. ^p B: A way the student could of improved the experiment validity is by having more trials and having the plastic strips the same length.\"\\n4124,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"I conclude that plastic type B has a stronger materials compared to the other types. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more trials, another way it would have been better is by saying how much weight was being used.\"\\n4125,2,0,3,excellent,average,Plastic type B stretches the most.

Also, the second trial was important because for plastic A.C, different amounts of length was recorded.^p b) One way to improve the experiment design is to tell how many weights are added to the clamps and how heavy they are. The students can then use these weights to test another trial which would make the design better. Because plastic D stretched the same amount in both trials, it\\'ll be best to create a third trial for each plastic.\"\\n4141,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,The conclusion that was made is that plastic type B stretched more in both trials compared to the othes 3 plastic types because plastic Type got 22 and 23 mm for both trials while the next best plastic type got 20mm for both trials. The student must include in the procedure the amount of weight to add for step 4. Also they should explain more for instance like what does the clamp do?\\n4142,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"Based on the data I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most out of any of the other plastics.^p Two ways that the student could have improved the design and /or validity of the results are by telling us what types of plastics). Second the student should have added a third part to the table, how much weight was being applied.\"\\n4143,2,0,3,excellent,average,The plastic type (B) stretched out the more in both trials than the other types of plastic.^p One way they could improve their experiment was to tell us how much weight they used on the clamps.^p Another one is they could have written down the length of plastic before they started to see the difference.\\n4144,2,0,3,worst,worst,There  wasn\\'t much of a difference between (T1) and (T2). It only stretched like 2mm at most and sometimes is even just stayed the same. One way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 1 more trial. Another way the student could have improved the experiment is by using several other materials not just plastic.\\n4145,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,Based on the students data you can conclude that Plastic B stretched the farthest and Plastic A stretched the least. Two ways this student could have improved this experiment is by providing the start length of each plastic before the weights are added. Another thing they could do to improve this experiment is to include the weight that was added to the clamp for each plastic.\\n4146,2,0,3,average,worst,\"a. Based on the student\\'s data, plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p b. First, the students should have mentioned what type of plastic to use to replicate the experiment, and it seems they used the same pieces of plastic for each type on both trials, which could cause inaccuracies because the first trial may have stretched the plastic out too much for the second trial.\"\\n4147,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"Based on the students data, my conclusion would be that T2 got more results than T1. Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design by giving more results, and measurements.\"\\n4148,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"a) Based on the data, the polymer plastic B is at the top of the list of stretchability at about 22.5 mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the validity of the trial could be to add one or two more trials. Also, he could have measured the spot were he put the type so thart each one started at the same spot.\"\\n4149,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"Plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. However, type A is the strongest of all of the plastics because it stretched the least and was able to support the weights. ^p The student could have specified how much weight to add to each plastic to keep the trials constant. They also should have specified which samples they were using and the size of each sample to maintain consistency throughout trials. Both of these would help improve the validity of the data.\"\\n4150,2,0,3,average,worst,The conclusion of this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the most with 23 (mm) with trial. ^p 2. A way to improve this experiment is clarify what the plastics is tested for and if it needs to be stretchy or not stretchy. Also to use different amounts of weights to see what the main stretch is. Also a control in this experiment to compare to could help.\\n4151,2,0,3,average,worst,Based on the students data you can conclude that for the most part all four types of plastic had almost the same length at mm stretched to the two trials. ^p Two ways the student can improve the experiment is that they could say what the starting length for each plastic type would be or they could increase the amount of time the plastic hangs from the table by.\\n4152,2,0,3,worst,worst,Well based on the student data plastic type B was the plastic that stretched the most on both trys. One way that student could the valdity of her expirment would to have a control. This way you have somthing to test the other results against.\\n4153,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"Based on the conclusion plastic type B resulted in the most stretched T1-22, T2-23. concluding that 1/4 it was the most strongest.The students should have added a specific amount of weight to the clamps as the same and concluding the results on the plastic type lastly the student should have performed the second trial with different measurement.\"\\n4154,2,0,3,average,worst,Plastic type B was the most stretchable and A was the least.

And I think that he could have done more data and more samples.\\n4156,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"From the students data table, one can conclude that plastic type \\'B\\' and \\'D\\' are more elastic  / are able to stretch more than plastic types \\'A\\' and \\'C\\'. The students could have improved their experiment by specifying and controlling the amount of weight added to each clamp and mentionity and maintaining the beginning dimensions of the polymer that subjects  (including thickness.)\"\\n4157,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,a) A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data can be that plastic type D has the most stretchability in both trials.^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results could be: (1) show each of the plastics original length before the trials. (2) If they did a 3rd trial with a longer time of heavier weights.\\n4158,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"From the graph shown I feel that plastic type \"\"B\"\" was more durable than the other plastic because at trial 1 it was the highest mm stretched and some for trial 2. ^P B. Two ways the student could have improved the design is to do more than just 2 trials. They could\\'ve also done it in different measurements.\"\\n4159,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"A. I could conclude from this students experiment that plastic B, was the stretchiest. B. The student could have made their experiment more reliable by specifying the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table.\"\\n4160,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"a) With the results provided, it is shown that plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second, compared to plastic A this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. B) The students should have specified the weights amount that was to be added to the plastic. They should have also said how much of the plastic should be taped to the table, different amounts could affect the amount of weight it could hold.\"\\n4161,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"In conclusson, plastic type D has the most stretchability. Two ways that students could improve the experiment is by having a control. They could also do more trials to receive a more acuret answer.\"\\n4162,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials. Therefore, it would most likely break faster than the others. Plastic type A stretched the least amount so, it would probably hold more before breaking. B) The students could have performed more trials. They could\\'ve also, use the same amount of weights each trial and for each plastic. It doesn\\'t say how much weight they used, just to add weights.\"\\n4163,2,0,3,average,worst,a. In conclusion if I take a sample of a type of plastic and measure its length then add weight to it and wait 5 minutes to see how much it is now.^p b. Two ways the student could have improve the experimental design is to add more trials. Another thing they could of did was try is add more thing for the weights.\\n4164,2,0,3,excellent,average,The students doing polymer lab can now know plastic type B had stretched the most and plastic type A had stretched the least. The second polymer had the greatest stretchability. Two ways they could have improved the design is taking the plastic over a cylindrical surface thats open and put weights on it to see if that affects it more. Also for better validity of their data they could\\'ve put how the plastic measured before and after instead of already skipping to the math part.\\n4165,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"In the data tables there are four different kinds of plastic types and they had to be stretched by weights, within both trials there wasn\\'t really a difference just that plastic type b had the longest trail. They could have told us what type of plastic wrap they used and they should have more trials.\"\\n4166,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"a)My conclusion is that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all the tested plastics. I came to this conclusion because as you see on the graph on T1 it reached 22 and T2 23 which was higher than all the other plastics tested.^p (b) They could have did more trials because the more they do, the more accurate there result are. Lastly, in the procedure when it says measure they should list the units they wanna use.\"\\n4167,2,0,3,average,worst,\"(a)1 Plastic 1 B stretched the most, so it would be best to carry heavier objects. ^p (b)1 Telling what kind of plastics they used were: ^p     2 Be more detailed by how long they stretched it for.\"\\n4168,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"Overall plastic B stretched the most followed by plastic D, C, then A. This lab needs a lot of work for it to be valid. First the amount of weight needs to be recorded. Also the origional lengths of the 4 plastics need to be on the table because although plastic B is the longest in the end, it may have started at 20mm, but we don\\'t know. Also they should do more trials.\"\\n4169,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"What I can conclude from the groups results is that polymer B has the least amount of resistance  to stretching. I know this because, plastic type B stretched an average length of 22.5 mm, this is larger than the three other plastics. Also, plastic type A had the most resistance to stretching because it only stretched an average length of b11mm. There is two ways to add validity and impede the experimental design. One way is to add a control to the groups and second, to have specific measurements for the amount of weight being added.\"\\n4170,2,0,3,worst,worst,The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results is add more weights to the clamp and take more time to change the data table.\\n4171,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"Based on the students data, plastics B and D are the most stretchable because they stretched the most in trial 1. Plastic B stretched 22 mm and plastic D stretched 20 mm. ^p The student could have specified how heavy the weights should be on the plastics. Also the student must use plastic samples of the same lengths so the results have more validity.\"\\n4172,2,0,3,average,worst,What kind of plastic was it.\\n4173,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"You can conclude that plastic B stretched the most, and plastic A stretched the least. One way the experiment could be improvd is making sure each plastic is the same length before the stretch. Another is to do the experiment for different time intervals, like five, ten, and fifteen minutes instead of just five minutes.\"\\n4174,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"Based on the data, we can conclude that plastic type A is the strongest of the four. One way the student could have improved this experiment, would be to first measure a specific amount all of the plastic types. He could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights & also make that a control.\"\\n4175,2,0,3,average,worst,A conclusion I can draw based on the students data is that plastic type A stretched the shortest amount and that plastic type D didn\\'t stretch at all but stretched the longest out of thin four types. One way that this design could have been improved is if the plastic types could have been named and the procedure should have added now high the table was in order to make the experiment work better.\\n4176,2,0,3,excellent,average,Plastic D it not even strectch. ^p B- include sofleg make is and start with the same mass for the plastic hags.\\n4177,2,0,3,average,worst,The student\\'s data was very accurate and it showed the less trechs plastic as well as the stretchiest plastic type. In the end the students could have improved the experiment by adding more trials to the experiment. Also more weighes on the plastics to have more accurate ressults.\\n4178,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,The students data is good the trial were coles in number. It seems that plastic type B was the streched with a lenth of 22 and 23 so the two trials helped the way. ^P I hes procedure he does not tell you what to meser in. He said to put a weight on the end but how much.\\n4179,2,0,3,average,worst,The conclusion of this investigation is that plastic type A is the most provable because it stretched the most out of the four types. The student could have improve this investigation by using all plastic types that were the same length. Also the student could have extended the stand time for trial 2.\\n4180,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"a) The more weight that was added onto the plastic bag and one longer the weights were on the plastic bag, the more it had streched out. Out of all the plastic bags type D had the least amount of resistance to be streched, plastic bag type A had the most amount of resistance to be streched. ^P b) One way that the experiment could have been improved was the amount of weight could have been specified. A second way that the experiment could have been improved was more trials could have been conducted.\"\\n4181,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"a) Plastic types A & C are the least stretchy, whereas plastic types B & D are the most stretchy.^p 1 b) Define the original length as the plastic, and keep it constant for all four plastics. 2b) Use different sizes weights for the trial to see if their is a difference in data.\"\\n4182,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"A conclusion that be drawn from the data table is that the, plastic type B had the most weights although they could have improved their experiment by. Clamping are side to a table, which the other side was clamping something that held the weights they also could\\'ve included the bag type and lenghth and width.\"\\n4183,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"a) In conclusion, plastic type B stretched more than plastic type A, C, & D. The purpose of this experiment was to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability. Data shows that plastic type c stretched more than plastic type A, but plastic B stretched more than all of the plastic types. The student could have improved their design by labeling the plastics by name and adding it to procedure.\"\\n4184,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"a) Based on the recorded data, I am able to conclude that plastic B was a weak poly ethilen product in which it has the highest stretchability through out the experiment. ^p The group could deffinetly improve their design by having each sample of plastic at a constant length, therefor your results are more valid. Also the group could create intervals of time to show the results after 5, 10, or 15 minutes to see the fluctuation.\"\\n4185,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"a) Based on the students data, I can conclude the B stretched the highest and A stretched the least. ^P b) The students could have told us how much the weights weighed. They also could have told us the original length of the plastic before stretching it.\"\\n4186,2,0,3,worst,worst,The student should have made the procedure less.\\n4187,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"a) I conclude that plastic B was the highest stretching plastic according to the graph it stretched 23mm, plastic A is the least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in trial two. ^P b) This experiment could have been improved by having each plastic stort at the same length and have the same amount of weight put on each plastic. The chart should include the original starting lengths of each of the plastics and the ending length.\"\\n4188,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,A.) Plastic type B stretched the most. ^p B.) They could have done multiple trials of each plastic.\\n4189,2,0,3,average,worst,a) Basically these students are trying to see which one of these bags are more durable than the other how much weight it can take. ^p b) The first way the students could have improved is that the could have measure the plastic and the second way they could have improve is to see how long they should leave it on before the bags break.\\n4190,2,0,3,average,worst,In conclusion the plastic material that was tested had a small amount of stretchability. In the experiment the plastic was strech at least 1mor millameter greater in the second trial versus the first trial also plastic type D was the only plastic that had no change within the two trials. Know two things I would change is first have the starting lengths of the plastic to see the difference from start to finish. Also specify how much weight you are laying on the end of the plastic.\\n4191,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"In conclusion, the plastic type have more amout stretched that the other one in both trial. For example in the first one he had 22 and the second he had 23.\"\\n4192,2,0,3,excellent,average,A conclusion drown based on the students\\' data would be plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the validity of the results is to have each type of plastic start at the same length. The students could have improved their experiment by putting the same amount of weights on each plastic.\\n4193,2,0,3,average,worst,a) My conclusion is that plastic type  B is the most stretchable. ^p To make this experiment more exact like should have been more trial and their should also have a control test.\\n4194,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"As shown in the data, most of the test subjects stretch by one, with so, this project was a success. ^p 1.

Add more trials. Explain how much waights are they using. How much of tape to use.\\n4196,2,0,3,average,worst,\"A) In conclusion it seems as though plastic type D was the weakest plastic being least, as it stretched 20mm in each trial. The strongest appears to be plastic A, which barely stretched; it was as an average of 11mm.^p b) One way that the student would\\'ve made this experiment was to make sure the weights they were using were kept constant, as this could easily affect how much the plastics stretched. A second way the student could\\'ve improved these experiment would be to add weights and the drop of the bottom at the same time, then immediately start taking so all the vinegar being used is both constant as well as the amount of time it\\'s left hanging pf the plastic.\"\\n4197,2,0,3,excellent,average,Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A stretched only 10 and 12 mm for each trial and plastic type B stretched 22 mm and 23 mm for each trial. ^p Two ways to improve this experiment. They probably should not use tape to hold the plastic on the table and they should try different amount of weights for different times.\\n4198,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"The conclusion of the different plastics is that mostly all the stretched further in the second trial then the first trial.^p One was the student could have improved the experimental design is instead of using a  clamp, just use the weights. And a second way the student could have improved the experimental design measure all plastics before anything else.\"\\n4199,2,0,3,worst,worst,Based on the data table I can conclude that plastic type A was a weaker or thinner plastic since it had stretched out the most. Also that plastic type D was strongest due to the fact that it didn\\'t stretch at all. A validity issue is that plastic type C had shrunk in size when the test was to see it stretch.\\n4200,2,0,3,above_average,average,a. The conclusion I came to is that plastic type D has the least strength there for it stretched the most. ^p The student could have specified how many weights to add into each clamp. The student also could\\'ve made each sample of plastic the same length so it would have been easier to measure and conclude how much the plastic stretched.\\n4201,2,0,3,worst,worst,A.) That type B plastic is the strogest type of plastic they used in this investigation. It held the same while streching the most.^p B.) One way they could have improved there data is which way the plastic was held with or against which has a big import. Also they did not state how much weight.\\n4202,2,0,3,worst,worst,3A) I would conclude that with basicly all the plastic that are being used in the experiment. They are all very close in the amount stretched when they are all the same plastic typed from T1 to T2. ^p 3b) And two way that a student could have improved the experiment was maybe having a T3 to see if it would change any of the data anything and keep the weights and clamps till it broke to really see how much it stretched.\\n4203,2,0,3,average,worst,\"My conclusion is that the numbers will go higher lowes and a way they can improve the trials is by putting more work in it, so it can be a good grade or data count.\"\\n4204,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,My conclusion is that for each plastic type it had stretched almost the exact same amount for both trials such as type D which had 20 for both trials. The students could have improved the experimental design by being specific as to how many weights should be added. They also should have written how far the cup should be hanging and to record their data.\\n4205,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"a. Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b. The student should have improved the experimental design by being more specific and indicating how much weight was added to the clamp. Also, the student could have experimented further by also testing the length of the bag after a longer period of time like 10 minutes.\"\\n4206,2,0,3,average,worst,\"a) The table doesn\\'t tell you much about how much they exactly stretched, the students only put what I assume the end length of the marble. Nothing can really be told with this information.^p (b) They should mention the types of plastics in the procedure because its not clear as to what materials they are referring to. Also they should have mentioned this in the table. On the table, the original lengths should have been recorded because otherwise you cannot tell how much it actually stretched.\"\\n4207,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,a) It is clear that plastic D is the least elastic and that plastic A is the most elastic plastic. ^p b) To improve the validity of the results the student could have done a third trial.

Based on the students data plastic A stretched 2mm, plastic B stretched 1mm, plastic C didn\\'t stretched it got stretch by 1mm and plastic D didn\\'t change at all. ^P b. Two ways that the students could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results is, first by making the procedures more clear. Second, to make it more accurate the amount of weight should be the same since you\\'re not measuring that and plastics should of been made of the same type of material.\"\\n4218,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"In the students experiment it is clear that polymer B is the most stretchable, than D, C, and last A.

This is because B had stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which was more than other plastic types. b) One way the student could have taken each sample and measured  how long it originally was instead of only \"\" measuring the length of plastic types\"\" for \"\" three plastic samples\"\". Also, the student could have had a third trial instead of just trial 1 and trial 2, making the results more valid.\"\\n4229,2,0,3,average,worst,\"In plastic type A there was a two milimeter increase between T1 and T2. Plastic type B only increase by one in its two trials. Type C had a decrease of one in the trials and D showed no signs of change. Plastic A seems to be the most stretchable polymer. These students could have improved their experiments by keeping the clamp and the weights on the plastic, stretch it and then measure to test the durability of the polymer as well.\"\\n4230,2,0,3,excellent,average,A conclusion based on the student\\'s data is plastic type B stretched the most with a stretch of 23mm whereas all the other plastics stretched less than 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are to run more trials and in the instruction give a certain length or size of the plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving you unaccurate results.\\n4231,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"a) You can\\'t really draw a conclusion because, the length of the material (before it was stretched) was not recorded. But the plastic with the biggest is plastic B and the least is plastc A.^p b) They could measure the plastic before stretching and determine how large the weights should be.\"\\n4232,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,a) A good conclution for this would be that type be streched the furthest. ^P b) Two ways the students could have made this better would to have tested exactly what type of plastic to use and how long each peice should be.\\n4233,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"a.) In conclusion, plastic type A and B increased two or one mm. Plastic type C decreased one mm. And lastly plastic. Type D stayed the same. So the only affected ones were plastic type A, B, and C. ^p b.) One way the student could improve was to have another trial. And a second way the student could improve was to add different weights.\"\\n4234,2,0,3,above_average,average,The strongest plastic type was it because it stretched the most in both trials. The weakest was b because it stretched the most in both trials.  So two ways they could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same clamps.\\n4235,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"(A) Based on the data graph it is clear the polymer B is the most strecthable because in T1 it stretched 22 cm and in T2 it strectched 23cm, beating the other polymers. ^p (B) The two ways they could have bettered this project is by 1, add more trials to it and 2. They could have validated more by writing their hypothesis to their experiment.\"\\n4236,2,0,3,worst,worst,My conclusion about this experiment is that T1 doesn\\'t strech more than T2 and all types of plastic have more strech of equal than each other. Student could improve their result by making more steps to see what could happe for the next type of plastic if they stay the same lik plastic D or change.\\n4237,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"A conclusion that can be drawn based on the data is that plastic B has the best stretchability because their average amount stretched was at least 2.5mm more than any of the other plastics. However, based on the procedure the data is not completely reliable. One way to make it more reliable would be to make the weights added to the clamp constant because otherwise more weight could stretch the plastic farther, creating more than one independent variable. Another way to improve the validity of the results would be to add a control, for example a clamp with no weights for each type of plastic, to ensure that the independent variable, the plastic type, is what affects the dependent variable, the amount the plastic stretches.\"\\n4238,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"a) In conclusion putting the weights on each state, caused the plastic to stretch. It didn\\'t stretch massively but it did make a difference. ^p b) One way the student could change it\\'s experiment is by saying how much weight was on each state, or the student could have added the types of plastic samples.\"\\n4239,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"(a) The conclusion that could be drawn from the data is that after vetting the plastic hang for 5 minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights, plastic B had the most stretchability. It stretched to 22mm in the first trial, and 23mm in the second. It was stretched 12 mm than plastic type A, the least stretchable plastic, in trial 2, and 11 more mm in the second trial. ^p (b) To improve the validity of the data, the student could have kept the starting length of the plastic constant, and the weight of the weights added to the clamp, keeping vairables constant will bring at more valid results.\"\\n4240,2,0,3,excellent,average,Plastic type A had the least stretchability at an average of 11 mm while plastic type B stretched the most averaging at 22.5 mm. ^p The amount of weight added should be included in the procedure to make the test more valid. Preforming more trials will always make an experiment more valid in that could help here.\\n4241,2,0,3,excellent,average,It was concluded that plastic type B stretched the most amount in both the second and first trial. The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials and having a control variables.\\n4242,2,0,3,worst,worst,Based on the student\\'s data you can conclude that plastic type A has the most strechibility while plastic type C was the least amount stretched in the two trials while plastic type A\\'s amount streched increased 2mm. Plastic type B\\'s amount streched decreased 1mm two ways the student could have improved the experiment of design and/or validity of the results would be by adding weights and letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways.\\n4243,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,A) Depending on the type of plastic will determine how much it will stretch with the added weights on it.^P B) The students could have tried it more times and they could have other types of plastic as well\\n4244,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,My conclusion are that plastic type B is the strechiest. It\\'s the most durable and can hold the most height. ^P 1. Use the most durable tape you can find strong duet tape will probably be fine. ^P 2. Make sure all the plastic pieces are the same size and appropriate size.\\n4245,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B) All the plastics should have been the same length to begin with and make sure the same amount of weight is being put on the different types of plastics.\\n4246,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"Type D is the stretchiest & most constant of the plastics tells how much weight to put on clamps, tell how long the samples was.\"\\n4247,2,0,3,average,worst,\"In conclusion, in trial2 the plastic stretched more than in trial .^p B) The students could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic and by allowing to let them hang longer.\"\\n4248,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"Plastic type B has the best stretchability. Plastic type D was in 2nd place with 20 mm for both trials. Plastic type C had 14mm for trial 1 and 13mm for trial 2. Plastic type A was the second. So plastic type B, with 22mm fro trial 1 and 23 for trial 2, is the winner.^p The students could have said how much weight is in the test. Another improvement could be to have 2 people and stretch the plastic, since stretchability is being tested.\"\\n4249,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,a) If plastic types are added weight to stretched the plastic B will stretch the farthest. This is supported by the data because in T1 and T2 it stretched the mos 22mm and 23mm ^p b)First they should have measured the in trial length so there is no confusing data.They also should have add more trials to improve the validity of the experiment.\\n4250,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"a) According to the data, plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least; it stretched 10mm the first time and 12mm the second time. Plastic C was the second strongest, followed by plastic D and then plastic B. ^p b) The student could have used the same weight or same amount of force on each bag. Also, the student could have used the same sized plastics for each plastic and each trial.\"\\n4251,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"A) According to the students data, polymer B stretched the most. ^P B) The student should specify the exact amount of weight to be attached to the plastic. The student should also specify which direction the plastic should be stretched, horizontally or vertically, because the direction of the polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic. For example, a plastic shopping bag tears easily from top to bottom but does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains are running top to bottom.\"\\n4252,2,0,3,excellent,average,A. In conclusion plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. Plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. ^p B. The student could\\'ve improved their experimental design by specifying the length of the plastics and by specifying how much the weights weighed.\\n4253,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"In trial 2 plastic type A stretched 2more millimeters than in trial , and plastic type D did not have any change. ^p The student could have completed more trials. Also the student could have how many weights before breaking.\"\\n4254,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,A) A conclusion is that plastic type B has stretched the farthest in both trial 1 reaching 22mm and in trial 2 reaching 23mm. The other 3 plastic types did not stretch as far as plastic B.^P B) The student could have improved the experiment by recording how long the plastics were before they were stretched and adding that data in the table. Also the student could have made sure each plastic was the same length and width before each of them were stretched. The student should have also listed the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastic.\\n4255,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that in both ones plastic type B has to stretch larger than my op the other three plastics. This data is not valid because there are many places within the experiment to increase the validity. The students could have recorded the starting length and ending length. Also they should have add the amount of weights a controlled variable and lost but not least the group should have had a third trial.\\n4256,2,0,3,worst,worst,Plastic B is the easiliest streached plastic. ^p They could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight. They could have tested more samples.\\n4257,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"A. Based on the student\\'s data the conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic, type B had the most stretchability.^p B. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to include exactly what plastics were used. Also they could have added what step weights they used to stretch the plastics.\"\\n4258,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"a) Based on the data ,I can assume that plastic B has the most stretchability because on both trials it stretched 21 and 23mm while the next closest only stretched 20mm.^p b) One way the student could here improved the experiment design is to start with the same length of each plastic without othey are constant .Also the student could have specified the amount of weight that was out on the clamp and the  student could also have made the amount of weight a constant.\"\\n4259,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"In trial 1vs trial 2 there wasn\\'t a tremendous difference in lengths. If anything happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters. Sample A had the least amount of millimeters but changed the most, while sample D had the most amount of millimeters and didn\\'t change at all. ^p 1 Use different sample of the same plastic for second trial. ^p 2 Make sure they are all coming from same temperature.\"\\n4260,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"A)Plastic type B stretched more than any type in both of its trials. (B)The student could have made sure each plastic was the same size to begin with. Also the student could have added the premier measurement to the chart, so he/she could draw more accurate conclusions.\"\\n4261,2,0,3,average,worst,Draw a investigation is meatanese.\\n4262,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"a) After recording the data, it is obvious that plastic type B can stretch the furthest and plastic type A stretches the least furthest. ^P b) One thing he could have done to improve his experiment was to list the weight as the weights because if there were different weights the entire experiment is forfeit. Another thing he could have done was to list the original length of plastic to see how much it actually stretched.\"\\n4263,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"C. A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B, C are the most resistant. ^p The students could improve the experiment by trying it a third time, and saying the amount of plastic use for all 4 plastic used. This is how the students can improve the experiment to have a more valid result.\"\\n4264,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"Based on the students data, polymer plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because the millimeters stretched on B trial 1 and 2 exeeded that of any other plastic (22mm & 23mm). The students could have included a third trial to increase the validity of the experiment. The student also could made sure each sample of plastic began at the same length. (control)\"\\n4265,2,0,3,excellent,average,a) The A plastic stretched the most while plastic C shrunk an inch and D did not stretch at all. B stretched an inch concluding that A was the most stretchable plastic. ^p b) They could have said how long to cut the plastic types and how much weight should be put on the clamp.\\n4266,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"Based on the information from the table, plastic type A has more stretchability than the rest. ^p The student could\\'ve tested longer because like I said before, time is a factor in determining things when testing. Also, the student should\\'ve added weights to the second trial.\"\\n4267,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"I can conclude that plastic B streatchs out the most and plastic A streachs out the least. I know this because plastic B streatches 22 to 23, and plastic A streachs 10-12. Two was to improve this experiment is to tell what type of plastic, and to add four more trials.\"\\n4268,2,0,3,worst,worst,Plastic B is a material that is the most flexible. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is having a control and measure all the plastics the same length when the experiment initiated.

The first way to improve the test is to use different brand name plastics to test the difference. Neat you need to do 3 trials to see if the lab is valid.\\n4274,2,0,3,average,worst,Plastic type A is definately the streatchiest where as plastic type D is the least stretchy. The student could have improved his experiment in many ways. 2 of these ways include: letting the plastic stretch more. The students should have waited longer than 5 minutes. The other way he/she could have improved the experiment is by: having a greater variety of plastics. The student only tested 4 types of plastics when there are many more.\\n4275,2,0,3,worst,worst,The plastic stretch out about the same they don\\'t  have that much difference.

Finally plastic A stretched the least. It is obvious that plastic B was the stretchiest in Comparison to the others with 10 mm in the first trial and 12 in the second.

Also, they should have given a specific weight to be added to the clamp measure this you would have made the experiment more valid.\"\\n4278,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"A) A conclusion that could wiads from the students data is that trial 1 and trial 2 both basically had the same number if it could be one higher or one lower. Also, the plastic type D is the most stretchable to both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by not only trying one experiment, testing it in four 1-10 trials.

Another conclusion would be that plastic type D didn\\'t stretch at all and stayed durable, which means it\\'s the strongest, throughout the 1st and the 2nd trial. Two ways this experiment would be obtaining at minimum 3 trials to test its validity and the other would be to identify the type of plastic and more importantly start at the same length of each plastic to keep the validity of the experiment valid.\"\\n4280,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"As you can see, plastic type A stretched the least and type B stretched the most. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment design would be to tell whatt.

But one way the students could have emproved their expeirement is with in the procedure they should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same types of plastic for both trials so your not using the same one.

Plastic B and D with the stretchness around 20-23 were the highest ones with more stretchness. ^p (b) Two ways the students could improved the experimental design or validity of the results is by making more trials and making sure they measured the same amount of stretchiness correctly, to be secure.\"\\n4311,2,0,3,average,worst,Add the fist two togahtr and that how I do it?\\n4312,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"1) Acording to the data, plastic B stretched the most, and with the exeption of D, the second trial tests only differed by 1 or 2 mm, from the first test. ^p 2) To have improved the experiment, the student could have stretched the plastics longer. The second time on used heavier weights during te second trial.\"\\n4313,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"After the experiment was over we concluded that plastic type B has been stretched the furthest from the weights pulling it down. Plastic type D was the second most stretched plastic then after that was plastic type C, and finally plastic type A. ^p The students didn\\'t show how long the plastic was before stretching it. So we didn\\'t know if all bags were the said length to start out. Another improvement could\\'ve have been telling exactly how much weight was added to the end of the bags.\"\\n4314,2,0,3,average,worst,\"To end our experiment we calculated our data together. For plastic type A, for T1 we got 10 for T2 we got 12. For B we got T1 22 and T2 12. For C we got T1 14 and T2 13. Last for plastic type D T1 was 20 and T2 20. The students could of used less weight for step 4. The student also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes.\"\\n4315,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"i conclude that plastic B stretched the most. Its T1 was 22 and its T2 was 23 A,C,D their T1 and T2 was lower but D had 20 for T1 and T2. for validity the students could have done the weights for all the plastic together instead of doing it separate, they could have done three trials instead of 2 trials.\"\\n4316,2,0,3,above_average,average,It appears that plastic type B stretched out the most and plastic type A stretched out the least. One way that the student could have improved their experiment would be to tell what kind of plastic to do.

A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is plastic type B has more Strechability than the other ones. ^p Two ways a student could improve the experiment design could be add more trials the minimum is three, and also make sure the plastic are all the same size to begin with. Doing this could also increase the validity of the of the experiment and make it more accurate.\"\\n4318,2,0,3,worst,worst,They could of added more weight and they could of let it hang for more than 5 min.

Another way is to make sure everything is all right.\\n4320,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,A. The plastic polymer with the most stretchablity was plastic type B. this is because it stretched 22 and 23mm. B.

Based on the data, I conclude that plastic type B Stretched the most during both trials. ^p b. Two ways the students could\\'ve improved their experiment was making the plastics all the same length before stretching them.

The student could have run another trial and also added more weights to make sure it would really stretch.\\n4333,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"(A) Overall, plastic type B had stretched the most. Plastic type B just stretched a little further. This means that plastic type B had the most resistence to the weights/clamps and this plastic would be the most durable to use B. One way to improve the design would be to measure all the plastics to the same length so the results come out more accurate. Another way could be to have weights all be the same weight so some plastic types don\\'t have advantage over others.\"\\n4334,2,0,3,worst,worst,a) The conclusion I drew from this experiment is that plastic D stretched the most.

Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design or validized their results is by increasing the # of weights and or time of the trials. Also, another way that could have made their results more valid is by having more than just results more valid.\"\\n4345,2,0,3,above_average,average,2) I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most amount out of all the other plastics. ^P b) The students could improve the experimental design by adding more trials and adding a control.\\n4346,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"A) When we tested four different polymer plastics to see which ones increased in length after adding weights, the results read that plastic B increased the most by 22-23mm. The plastic that increased by 10-12mm. ^p B) One way the students could have improved their procedure was by specifying how much weight they added to the plastics. Another way to improve validity is to add a third trial to the experiment.\"\\n4347,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,The conclusion I have drawn based on the students data is that plastics B and D are the best polymers because those were the two plastics that had stretched the farthest on both trials. ^p Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to do even more trials. Also they would need to make sure that the free edge hanging from the plastics are the same length each time.\\n4348,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"A) From the information of the graph I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most for both trials the amount stretched was the highest. ^p 3b) Ways those students could improve there expirement, is by being more detailed in those procedure. Another way would be to perform more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and compare notes.\"\\n4349,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,Plastic B is the strongest with the length of 23. One why the student could improve their results is how much the weights weigh. Another way is how heavy was the clamp.\\n4350,2,0,3,average,worst,\"In conclusion based on the student\\'s data, plastic type D had the same amount stretched 20mm. However, Plastic type A had 10mm the first trial and it stretched more to 12 on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by writing the types of plastic instead of type A,B,C and D. Another way the students could have improved is by adding a prediction to what they thought was going to happen.\"\\n4351,2,0,3,average,worst,According to the chart Trial 1 was more effective than trial 2.

(T3)\\n4352,2,0,3,above_average,average,\"I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable, followed by type D, followed by type C, followed by type C, followed by type A. One way the experiment could be improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the strips and to make sure all of the plastic starts at the same size. Another way to improve is to perform more than 2 trials.\"\\n4353,2,0,3,average,worst,a. Plastic type A is the most stretchable and type d is not stretchable at all. ^p b.

Plastic type D come in 2nd with 20 mm. Type C in 3rd with 13.5 and type A in just with 11. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by first allowing a length every plane of tape should be before starting. The student could also provided a number of weights or amount of weight applied to are placed of type, all of which should have the same amount.\"\\n4356,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,a) The conclusion based from the student data would be the more weights added to the plastic types the more likely it would be for the plastic to stretch. ^p b) The student could improve the experiment design by adding specifically how much the weights weigh. Another improvement would be to do more trials.\\n4357,2,0,3,above_average,average,Based on the data found by the students in the polymer investigation plastic B had the most tensile strength or could stretch the most tensile plastic A had the least tensile strength. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by performing 3 or more trials for validity. Also the student could have included the weight of each weight that was stretching the plastic.\\n4358,2,0,3,excellent,average,a) My conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the farthest and plastic type A is thicker because it didn\\'t stretch as much.^p B) The student should have only did 3 trials and they should have told us what kind of plastic was used for the experiment.\\n4359,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"3. a) According to the results, plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least (in mm is the first trial and 12 mm in the second ). Plastic type B is the weakest out of the four because it stretched the most(22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second). b) These are ways the student could have made their experiment better.1) Take all plastic samples with the same length. 2) Add weights into the clamp until the plastic stretches out to its full potential rather than ileting it hang for five minutes. 3) Do a third trial.\"\\n4360,2,0,3,average,worst,\"In conclusion, the plastics were expirimented and plastic that had the potential to strech most was plastic B which results were 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. The one that least stretched was plastic A with 10mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. All the other plastics results that were tested were in between.\"\\n4361,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"It seemed as if the plastic stretched further or stayed the same in these trials. Type A stretched from 10mm to 12mm. Type B 22mm to 23mm. Type C 14mm to 13mm, and type D 20mm to 20mm. ^p B) The student should have been more specific with their table. the student also could have stated his validity better in or while doing his experiment.\"\\n4362,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"a) According to the data it can be inferred that plastic B\\'s polymer plastic stretches the most compared to the other plastics. It can also be concluded that the data is prease due to the closeness of the number from the 1st trial to the 2nd trial.^P b.) The student could improve the experimeat by having the amount of plastic used a constant. This allows the student to have only one independent variable. (The type of plastic). They can also explain that the weights most be the same weight for plastic, so the data is not effected.\"\\n4363,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"a) B stretched out the most because it stretched out, a total of 45(mm) A 22, C27 and D 40.

Another conclusion one could draw is that when conducting the experiment on plastics type D, it was probably the most reliable and had many controls, because the amount stretched (mm) stayed exactly the same. ^p b) One way the student have improved the experiment design was by measuring the same side of bag for A,B,C,D( in# 1) Another could be to add equal weights (#4) to each type of bag.\"\\n4371,2,0,3,above_average,average,Based on the students data the polymer plastics all had had different weights because all stretched out differently. To better the experiment the lab needs to include the stretching measurement so there can be data to compare before & after. Another thing would to for all plastics is store on the same length.

Polymer in A is not very strecher nor is the one in C. ^P B) Ways to improve both the design and validity include using something strongest than tape to hold up the plastic and weight, also using a timer to improve valibility.\"\\n4375,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,A) According to the results of the students plastic B was stretched out the most.

Plastic type B will stretch the most if weights was put on it and for 5 minutes. 6P (A) The student could have improved this lab by adding specific measurements to certain steps such as how much weight should be added in step 4. (B) The student could have also improved rethis lab by making each plastic the same length. In step 1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length. If you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate.\"\\n4383,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"Plastic type A stretched longer the second that, so did plastic type B.

When the students added the weight to the plastic and it stretched out to do the longest in both trials. Trial 1 it was 22mm and in trial 2 it was 23mm. 2 was that the students would of improved this experiment is to perform more trials to receive the most accurate answer, and they could of had control and see how the plastics stretch with no weight on them.\"\\n4386,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"Based on the students data, Plastic Type B stretched the most.

Both trials you did and start do\\'n saying that it was stretched further than the other 3 samples, which the data keeps accurately valid. The experiment design was poor. One way this student could have improved their design is to have been more specific in measurements, the size of the plastic samples, how much hangs, are the tight, etc. Another way to improve the validity of their results is to perform more than just 2 trials.\"\\n4390,2,0,3,above_average,average,The data that the student got is corrupted. The reason I say this is because he/she should have wrote on the data table the starting measure of each bag. He/she could have also used the same amount of weight written it on the procedures to get more accurate results. Another way that the student could have improved would be doing another trial to make that the results are accurate.\\n4391,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,In conclusion to the data gathered by the students I have come to the conclusion that the polymer plastic type A has streched the least therefore making it the most stable. And that polymer plastic type B was the least to strech the most therefore being the least stable. The students could have increased the validity of there results by adding more variables such as amount of weight applies. As well as adding even more trials.\\n4392,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"a) It can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A, the least. ^p b) The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and mass. For example, if B was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, another problem going off of that is that the mass of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that the results are valid.\"\\n4393,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"A) According to the data table testing the stretchability on 4 different polymer plastics, plastic B is the stretchiest because it stretched 22-23mm. The other types of plastics didn\\'t stretch this much. ^P B) One way this experimental design could be improved is to say the 4 different kinds of plastics used. Another way this can be improved is to tell us how much weight to add to the clamp when stretching the plastic.\"\\n4394,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"To inquire hi experiment be could of said how much weight he added the the plastic bags.

After that they needed as if there hypothesis was correct and if not explain why it wasn\\'t.\\n4398,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"a) A  conclusion based on the student\\'s data would be that plastic type A would be the stretchiest plastic because it stretched the most at two mm, while type B and C stretched one mm, and type D didn\\'t stretch at all.^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to record the measure of plastic before stretching on the data table, and also to add more trials.\"\\n4399,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,Plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p The student should have made sure all of the plastics were the same length before preforming the experiment. If all the plastics are different lengths we have no way of knowing if they stretched because of the length or because of the type of plastic. He or she should also have indicated the weight attached to the clamp. Otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity.\\n4400,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,(a) Plastic B stretched the longest in trial 2 23 mm and plastic D being the second longest and A having the shortest amount stretched. ^p (B)  The student could have had the clamps hang a longer time rather than just 5 minutes and they could of had a third trial because some plastic stretched longer the second time round.\\n4401,2,0,3,average,worst,Based on the students data there really wasnt any difference in the animals stretched. The students could have put more weights on they even could have extends the time hanging to improve the experiment design and / or validing of the results.\\n4402,2,0,3,above_average,average,A conclusion can be that plastic types B and D are more strecthable than plastic types A and C. One way they could have improved is by adding the plastics\\' original length in the graph to help show that they did strecth. Another way is to have include the weight of the weights so that it can be duplicated if needed.\\n4403,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"A.

The student could have also checked his work more frequently to see exactly how long it took for each of the pieces of plastic to lower.\"\\n4404,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,\"a. As you can see, plastic B could stretch longer than any plastic. Plastic D had similar results for both trials. Plastic A was the only plastic that was able to not stretch that far.^p b. What this student should do to improve his experiment is to run more trials and to add what he is comparing to.\"\\n4405,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"Based on the information provided from the experiment, I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability (22mm, 23m) and plastic A is the least stretchability (10mm, 12mm). Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their lab was to cut the same length of each plastic prior to testing stretchability and to specify the amount and mass at the weights to added.\"\\n4406,2,0,3,average,worst,\"My conclusion is that the plastic that can stretch more is plastic B because it has the longest accounted stretched in mm, and other plastics do not stretch longer than plastic B.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by putting one set of weights in T1 and another st of weights in T2. Also they could have improved by letting it hang for more time to see if they can resist.\"\\n4407,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"a) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most flexible and plastic A is the least. ^p b) The student needs to perform at least 3 trials with each plastic for it to be valid also, the student set a length at which plastic should initially be. This will improve validity as well.\"\\n4408,2,0,3,worst,worst,\"My conclusion is that the type of plastics similar to strength because none of them had a huge difference, but type B and D are closer to farthest one is 23, the other 22 is now A and C are closer one is 12 the other 13.

Plus a way to improve this experiment would be have more trials because there wasn\\'t that many data to compare and the ones they had wasn\\'t relly of a difference.\"\\n4409,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"a) Based on the students data plastic type B streched the most out of any other type of plastic. b) To improve the experiment the students could have increased the amount of time they would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all the plastic may have needed was more time. To improve the validity of the results the students should have included the plastics orginal length in the table.\"\\n4410,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"a) As you guys can see the sample of plastic B was the most strechable plastic out of all of them, the plastic B streched the most in both trials.^p b) 1 ways that the student could of changed the experiment by labeling the plastics that he used. 2 He also could of changed the weight of the clamp.3) He could of also added another try to make sure that witch is the most strechable plastic.\"\\n4411,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"Based upon the data plastic type B, stretches the most.

So plastic type B held the most mm in both trials. The only plastic close to it was plastic type D which had 20mm in trail 1 and 20mm in trial 2. Since plastic type B held B held more in both trials, then plastic type B is the can hold the most. The way the students could have improved their experiment is by having more trials. This would have improved the validity of their results. Another way is by making it longer than 5 minutes to let the plastics hang, because it might leave longer stretch much.\"\\n4414,2,0,3,excellent,excellent,A) It seems like plastic B has the most stretch ability because it stretched 22 mm in T1 and 23 T2. ^p B) To improve the experimental assign the students could have kept the amount of weight they carried to the bag constant and they could have kept the weights for another five minutes and measured it again afterwards.\\n4415,2,0,3,above_average,above_average,\"In the second trail two plastics, A and B, stretched out more unlike 2 and B, C stretched less the second time while D stayed the same.

In this expierement, plastic type A proved to be the least stretchiest while plastic type  proved to be stretched the most. ^P The students could have said how many weights to be add or how heavy they total up to be. ^P The students could have also said what type of plastics they used so we can test it our selves.\"\\n4420,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"Based on the students data the conclusion that plastic B has the most stretchability because it has the highest length in millimeters after the experiment. Two things the students could have done to improve the experimental design and validity of the results would be holding the variables more controll.

The overall stretchings of the plastics remained mostly the same from T2 to T2. ^p b.) Taping the plastic a specific distance in from the table edge and adding identical and specified amounts of weight to each plastic would improve the validity, especially when working with such small length chances.\"\\n4425,2,0,3,worst,worst,a) Based on the students data the plastic don\\'t stretches a lot much type 1 and type 2 are almost the same and dont have a much difference.^p b)\\n4426,2,0,3,excellent,above_average,\"A) Based on the data, plastic B stretched the most out of the four plastics. ^p B) One way to improve the experiment is to specify how much the weights weigh (4).

One way the students could improve their experiment is to add a third trial (B). This would allow for better results because its experiment is being done 3 trials and an average could be made. Another improvement would be to add different weights to see how far each plastic will stretch.\"\\n4431,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"1) The most stretchable plastic with the most tensile strength, is plastic D, because during both trials it stretched further than all the other plastics.^p 2) a) They could have formulated a hypothesis so that their experiment would have become more guided.b)They could have made sure that each plastic (before stretching) was the same length.\"\\n4432,2,0,3,average,worst,\"A) Based on the students data, my conclusion to this is that plastic type D would be the most stretchable, because for both trials, the mm of the length was still the same. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by telling the differences of the two trials, and also did a different polymer plastic have an effect on how it would stretch.\"\\n4433,2,0,3,excellent,average,\"a) This experiment on polymers turned out to work perfectly without any weird results. For example in this experiment plastic/ polymer B performed the best because in trial one it stretched about 22mm and in trial two it increased flexibility by stretching 23mm. While on the other hand plastic /polymer A experiment the worst because in trial one it only stretched about 4mm and in trial two it only increased its flexibility to 12mm. ^p B)Two ways that those students could have improved this experiment is  by naming the plastic in which they tested and also they should have measured how heavy the weights are to get a more set on judgement , more trials, more attempts & more accurate results.\"\\n4434,2,0,3,above_average,excellent,\"Based on the data plastic A had the most significant growth in Amount streched with streching 2 mm faster than it\\'s original trial therefore this polymer has the most streachability. ^p The student could of had an control, also same amount of weights, and did more trials.\"\\n4435,2,0,3,excellent,average,The conclusion based on the student\\'s data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the farthest with 22m in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial.

She works a four-hour shift at a restaurant, goes to school and still helps out with household chores like helping her Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.

She is so hardworking that Aunt Kolab notices it. Aunt Kolab says during their converstion that maybe they can find a way that is better for Rose. One that will take so much stress off of her. This shows that she must work hard for the family to keep it running. It shows that Rose is very hardworking.\\n18917,7,0,2,average,worst,\"Rose\\'s trait displayed in the story is that she is a very hard worker especially for her family.  When she talks about her day is begins with \\'From school she\\'d gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift, then staight home to help Aunt Kelob prepare a quick supper.\"\\n18918,7,0,2,worst,worst,Rose is caring in the way that she does not want to trouble others with her own conflicts.

This is shown through her conversation with Anna when she hides her emotions from Anna. This is an example of protectiveness because she is doing what is best for her by not showing that she is scared as well. This will give Anna a sense of comfort to think that someone is in control. Another example is when Anna first walks in and the first thing Rose does is ask if she is ok.\\n18921,7,0,2,excellent,excellent,Rose is a very kind person.

She also always puts herself last before others.\\n18925,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"Rose has a trait that makes her seem to herself as helpless.  This is a good trait because you can do more work when you have something that needs done although you do not know why.  You feel helpless and so you do something that needs done without you really even knowing you did it.  Rose is talking to Ana at the time that this trait exposes itself.  It says, She tried a laugh taht sounded fake even to her.  This is trying to get her sister to no feel so bad about Papa leaving to go  to Los Angeles.  She is also trying to get her to know that it is their responsibility to support Paul through college.\"\\n18926,7,0,2,worst,worst,Rose is very stressed because of this essay.

She is very determind to get the essay done and help her family and her brother.\\n18928,7,0,2,average,worst,\"Even though it doesn\\'t say in the story, but you can kind of get a hint that Rose is older than Anna, but also younger than Paul. Paul is away, so Rose has to step in and be the mature one and watch after her little sister. She is mature, because in the conversation with Anna talking about her father, Rose is trying to soothe Anna\\'s thoughts about missing her dad.\"\\n18929,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"If I had to use one trait to describe Rose from this story, I would say she is overwhelmed. In this story, I could tell by her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab that she felt like she had too much resting on her shoulders. For example, when Aunt Kolab says \\'...

She is worried about what will happen and is feeling great pressure from her family to succeed and to contribute to the family.  I drew this from her Aunt\\'s response to the dream, when she said, \\'Do you feel so weighed down by what you\\'re doing to help the family?\\', a question  she did not answer because the truth would hurt her aunt.\"\\n18934,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"rose tried to anna can understand the real problem with their parents and she is trying to do her best to have a good family by her side but anna just dont get the situation. for example rose told anna that her parents need to work more and that they have to appreciate the opportunity that they are having in their job and anna just dont get that, thats a good opportunity for her family.\"\\n18935,7,0,2,worst,worst,Rose can be described by being stressed. In the story it state that her brain became exhausted and is always busy moving from one activity to another.\\n18936,7,0,2,average,worst,I feel she is respectful because she listens patiently while the other person is speaking.\\n18937,7,0,2,average,worst,\"Rose seems to always act like the mother in the house when her mother works late.

In her conversation with Anna, Anna has a different view of the story because she is younger and doesnt have to work she doesnt see the unjust position that her older sister and he mother are in. She doesnt understand why their father had to leave for a better paying job. Anna has a lot of resentment towards her family but she is continually trying to surpress her feelings. In Anna and Rose\\'s conversation \\'Anna glared at Rose. \\'Money isn\\'t everything\\' \\'Only if you already have everything,\\' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. \\' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he\\'ll get a good job, Anna, and he\\'ll pay for you and me to go to college.\\' This reveals that even though Rose loves her family she resents that she has to help send her brother to school, but she is putting on a brave face for her little sister and saying that even though they have to work hard it will all get better soon.\"\\n18939,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"Rose is composed. She is breaking under the weight of her essay, her job, and all the stress in her life, yet when Anna comes in to talk about her nightmare, Rose is calm and collected. \\'I\\'m fine,\\' her sister said. \\'I just had another bad dream.\\' Anna is distracting Rose from spending much needed time on her essay with a mundane topic, but Rose still speaks gently to her with the compassion of a loving sister.\"\\n18940,7,0,2,excellent,above_average,She is a very respectful person because Rose didnt answer her Aunt Kolabs question because it would hurt her aunt since she feels so weighed down by helping out her family.\\n18941,7,0,2,average,worst,One trait that can describe Rose is caring.

This is shown during her conversation with her sister, Anna.  Anna is complaining about their father being gone but Rose argues that their father needed the far away job to help pay for Paul\\'s, their older brother, college education so that when he gets a job he will help to pay for their education.\"\\n18946,7,0,2,excellent,above_average,\"Rose is a hard worker who works to exhaustion, as can be seen when she says, \\'I fell asleep working on my essay,\\' to Anna.\"\\n18947,7,0,2,average,worst,\"While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, one trait that I saw was that her Aunt was very supportive.

While talking to her sister, Rose says that her father went off for the better-- to make more money. Anna, Roses\\'s sister, is furious and explains that money is not everything in life.Rose disagrees and says that they have to help Paul get through college, then herself, and Anna. She feels like she has to put the weight on her shoulders to benefit others. She overachieves, or tries to, throughout the beginning of the story.\"\\n18955,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"She tells her aunt everything and is very trustworthy, but she feels guilty about what happened to her brother.

It was not until her dream about Paul\\'s body drowning her that she realized how stressed she really was.

Rose fits in school, work, and helping her aunt cook dinner each day, even though she feels she has too much to handle. She continues to do these things because she feels it is her responsibility to help her family. In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, she admitted that she felt weighed down by everything she was doing. Her aunt then offered to sell treats from Cambodia to lessen Rose\\'s responsibility, leaving Rose feeling lighter.\"\\n18967,7,0,2,worst,worst,I think that Rose is resentful of the fact that her family is not with her.

She is trying to succeed in school, help out around the house, and blance a job. Although her situation isn\\'t ideal, she performs the same tasks everyday. I noticed her maturity when her Aunt asked is she felt weighed down by the family. Rose didn\\'t reply because she didn\\'t want to hurt her Aunt. This shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others, but also understand her families situation. At her age, this shows maturity.\"\\n18975,7,0,2,above_average,excellent,\"Rose is very determined. She does everything she can to help pay for her brother\\'s college, even though she is exhausted and stressed.

During the conversation with Anna, Rose is asking her whats wrong and if she feels okay. She cares about her and her family. One other example would be when she is talkin to Aunt Kolab she doesnt want to tell her that its too much work for her to handle. She doesnt want to upset them, because she cares about how they feel.\"\\n18978,7,0,2,above_average,average,\"Rose is a dedicated person. While she is talking to Aunt Kolab, she figures out what topic she is going to write her essay about, which shows her dedication to getting her work done. Rose is also proved to be dedicated by working on her essay until she falls asleep and keeps up with school and a job.\"\\n18979,7,0,2,above_average,average,\"Rose cares about how other people will feel if she really tells them how she feels.

Like she works at a restuarant to help around the house. Rose\\'s mother always have to work late.\\n18987,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"One trait attributed to Rose is a sense of hopelessness. In the dream, she puictures her self collapsing under the weight of her responsibilities, and under her brother\\'s.\"\\n18988,7,0,2,average,worst,She is very mature and you can tell because she can fell the stress from Paul and knows her responsibilities.\\n18989,7,0,2,worst,worst,She has always been so busy.\\n18990,7,0,2,excellent,excellent,\"She has faith in everything she does, and she cares about her sister. I believe its because she tells her sister that everything will work out and that they will go to college like their brother.\"\\n18991,7,0,2,worst,worst,Rose hides how she really feels to both of the characters. This is one trait that she has and she shows it by not saying what she really whats too.\\n18992,7,0,2,worst,worst,One character trait that I can identify about Rose is that she is not very outspoken due to her conversation with Aunt Kolab. She seemed like she was scared to tell her aunt how she relly felt because she was afraid of hurting her aunt\\'s and her mothers feelings.\\n18993,7,0,2,worst,worst,Rose is faithful. She is faithful because she doesn\\'t want to hurt anyone in her family. She does what she is asked because she knows its the right thing to do.

Rose is a good person.\\n18994,7,0,2,average,worst,\"Rose acts like she is resentful to her family. When she lists all the struggles she went through with her normal day, it sounds like she resents having to do what seems like all the work. She goes to school, then to work at a restraunt, then she had to go home and work more to prepare dinner.\"\\n18995,7,0,2,average,worst,\"One trait that can describe Rose is a presistance. Her school day was very long. After school, she went to work and did a long shift, then came home and made supper, and now she was trying to make a three-thounsand word essay. That takes someone who is a hard worker and who is persistant.\"\\n18996,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"Rose is very understanding in her attempt to calm Anna down. This trait is expressed by the way she trys to explain why Papa is gone.

When Anna came into the kitchen to talk to her after her nightmare, she started talking about how she misses Papa and she wishes Mama didn\\'t have to work such late hours.

One example from the passage would be when Anna rolled her eyes and shoved the chair away from the table and said \\'You sound just like mama\\'.\\n19006,7,0,2,worst,worst,Rose doesn\\'t think she is all to great.  In the beginning she was having trouble writing an essay.  She then tells her sister how she fell asleep while writing it and thinks money is everything.  Then later on she tells her Aunt Kolab of her dream and how much pressure is on her.  Rose thinks she is the underdog in the family.\\n19007,7,0,2,worst,worst,\"A trait to describe Rose would be stressed.

Because Paul is unaware of Mr. Leonard\\'s past, and is used to following his orders, Paul is willing to try the things Mr. Leonard confronts him with. As stated in paragraph one, the last sentence, \\'everyone complied.\\' No one questioned Mr. Leonard, and therefore his past was never questioned.     When Mr. Leonard becomes empathetic towards Paul, it changes things. When you become used to someone, it becomes easier to question and learn about them. Paragraph eight foreshadows this relationship when it says the Mr. Leonard\\'s \\'gaze softened\\' towards Paul.     Not knowing about Mr. Leonard really has as much effect in the early stages of their acquaintance as much as later learning changes their relationship. When the coach writes out a web address and tells Paul, \\'Visit this site. Do a search for \\'Grabowski,\\'\\' it precludes the notion that Mr. Leonard\\'s life was dull and without bother for question. Rather, it changes the accepted lack of knowledge to a pursuit of mystery.     Finally, when Paul learns of the reading impairment that he shares with the old janitor, the relationship is solidified because they have a common ground. Once the existance of this common ground is justified, that is, once Paul realizes that there is a common place between them, Leonard Grabowski becomes a much less abstract and more relateable figure.

It tells us that there are objects positioned hundreds of miles above Earth and some of them circle the planet indefinitely. Now, once this piece of high-teck space object \\'dies\\' it become one more piece of junk added to space, which makes a problem because now its circling the globe in an uncontrolled manner.     Then it leads us into the crash course section explaining the now dead satellites have the risk of crashing into one another. The effect of that happening now causes the problem of tiny little pieces of debris floating around all throughout space. But those pieces are not the only debris that roams the atmosphere, any object that are released into space become free-orbiting satellites. So are astronauts have to be very cautions while in space to be sure nothing is left out in the open.     The last topic the author touches on is how little things propose a bigger problem. Those little pieces are flying around at five miles per second! That is pretty dangerous because when we send our spacemen up there, if one of those were to hit the shuttle, it could easily go strait through it, or damage it to a certain degree that would only make their journey more difficult.

Next the author tries to inform his readers about some of the major accidents that created alot of space junk, he does this when he explains the instance of the two satalites colliding.  Lastly the author tries to explain to the reader that the space junk may be small but it is very dangerous, as seen when the author says that the bits even though they are small present a very serios problem.

Perhaps the author had no clue as to how to combine everything into one, or had too much information to combine it all into one.

Where as White at its first trial got 42(DEG)C and 41(DEG)C for its last trial\"\\n28108,10,0,2,above_average,above_average,\"light gray ::  Since the doghouse will have a living being in it, the temperature should be comfortable for the dog. 53(DEG) C is very, very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable, especially on a warm su mmer day. But, 41(DEG) C is too cold for a dog in the winter time, as this would be a year-round house for the dog. So, 45(DEG) C would be less hot in the summer, and more warm in the winter, which is just perfect for the dog.\"\\n28109,10,0,2,average,worst,white :: it wont exorb that much heat so it will cool insiode the dog house\\n28110,10,0,2,excellent,above_average,\"white :: White will keep the doghouse at a cooler temp erature than any of the other colors will, thus preventing the dog from o ver heating. This is proven by the fact that after ten minutes, a jar wit h a white lid had an increased temperature of 18(DEG)C, while jars with darker lids (ranging from light gray to black) had an increase in tempera ture of anywhere from 21(DEG)C to 29(DEG)C. The white lid kept the jar cooler, so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well. This is healthier fo r the dog.\"\\n28111,10,0,2,average,worst,black ::  the color black would effect the air tempature of the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorbe more energy.\\n28112,10,0,2,worst,worst,\"black ::  If you painted the outside of a dog-house, th en the inside would be warmer. No matter what color you painted the insid e.\"\\n28113,10,0,2,average,worst,\"white :: white would be the best color to chose for th e doghouse, because white reflects off the sun. It doesnt absorb it like black, dark grey, or grey.\"\\n28114,10,0,2,above_average,average,\"dark gray :: The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because its close to median of the data. Also, the average temperature for dark gray is 48(DEG)C, this shows that the color can a bsorb and reflect light, so in cold days the doghouse will stay warm and on hot days the temperature inside the doghouse will be cooler.\"\\n28115,10,0,2,worst,worst,dark gray :: it will keep the temperature the same at all times\\n28116,10,0,2,excellent,average,\"white ::  The white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out. From the experiment, the white lid was the co olest out of all four lids.\"\\n28117,10,0,2,average,worst,white ::  White will keep the doghouse cool becuase it reflects light instead of absorbing it\\n28118,10,0,2,excellent,excellent,white :: White will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black. White had a average of 42(DEG)c and black was 53(DEG) c.\\n28119,10,0,2,above_average,above_average,\"light gray :: Light Gray was the color I would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because, since black absorbs the most ener gy and the inside would have been hot. Dark Gray would have done the same thing as Black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed. Lig ht Gray would have been a perfect color, not only absorbing the perfect a mount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors B lack and Dark Grey.\"\\n28120,10,0,2,above_average,average,\"light gray ::  As shown in experiment that Brandi and Jerry conducted, we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs. Knowing this, we wouldn\\'t want the dog to get overheated, so we would panint the dog house the lightest color available. Which in this case, is white. Though, the dog, being a live creature shouldn\\'t get too cold, therefore, light gray is the perfect compromise. Keeping the dog wa rm enough, but not too hot.\"\\n28121,10,0,2,average,worst,\"black :: This color black, could affect the doghouse b ecause the dog could get very hot in the Summer time. Also, the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun and start to erode.\"\\n28122,10,0,2,average,worst,dark gray :: i chose dark gray because it stayed the same heat every trial so it wouldnt be to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter\\n28123,10,0,2,excellent,excellent,\"white :: Durring the experiment, Brandi and Jerry foun d out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. If the white color was paint ed apon the top of the dog house, then the temperature wouldnt rise as mu ch as the black coored paint because, jerry and Brandi made there experim ent and got the results of white having the least affected air temperatur e when a lamp is directed at the jar. For example, on Trial 1, the white container had an air temperature of 42(DEG)C versis the air temperature in the black jar of 54(DEG)c.\"\\n28124,10,0,2,worst,worst,light gray ::  its cool but it gets some heat for the dog\\n28125,10,0,2,worst,worst,white :: Its Going To Be Cooler For The Dog In The Ins ide Than The Darker Colors Because they do absorb more energy and that wi ll make the doghouse very hot in the inside.\\n28126,10,0,2,average,worst,light gray ::  light gray could affect the inside of the dog house cause the color is not to dark so that it wont be to hot and its n ot to light so it wont be to cold the temperature will be just fine.\\n28127,10,0,2,excellent,average,\"white :: it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors becuase it stayed in a termperature of low 40(DEG)C. li ght gray was in high mid 40(DEG)C, dark gray in high 40(DEG)C, and blac k was in low 50(DEG)C proving that lighter colors keep the air temperatu re cooler\"\\n28128,10,0,2,above_average,average,\"light gray :: I picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat. So that means lighter colors help reflect. Light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a l ittle, and in the some helps reflect a good amount.\"\\n28129,10,0,2,above_average,above_average,black ::  they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be absorbed. The black lid was an average of 5(DEG) warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house\\n28130,10,0,2,average,worst,light gray :: The tempature of the dog house would be from 44(DEG)C to 46(DEG)C.
