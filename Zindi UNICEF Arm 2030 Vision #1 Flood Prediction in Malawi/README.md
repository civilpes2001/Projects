## Problem
On 14 March 2019, tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall at the port of Beira, Mozambique, before moving across the region. Millions of people in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe have been affected by what is the worst natural disaster to hit southern Africa in at least two decades.

In recent decades, countries across Africa have experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of floods. Malawi has been hit with major floods in 2015 and again in 2019. In fact, between 1946 and 2013, floods accounted for 48% of major disasters in Malawi. The Lower Shire Valley in southern Malawi, bordering Mozambique, composed of Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts is the area most prone to flooding.

The objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning model that helps predict the location and extent of floods in southern Malawi.

This competition is sponsored by Arm and UNICEF as part of the 2030Vision initiative.
