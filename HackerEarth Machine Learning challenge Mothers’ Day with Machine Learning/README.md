## Problem statement

While every day should be Mothers' Day [’cuz they rock], we are all guilty of taking to social media to post mushy messages or images on the second Sunday of May for our mothers. However, the Human Resources team of your organization wishes to celebrate and honor all moms currently employed at the company with a special monthly event. For one of such events, they have reached out to your team to curate and categorize Mothers’ Day-related tweets from across the globe.

As a Machine Learning Engineer, your task is to build a sophisticated sentiment analysis-based NLP model that can classify sentiments of tweets into positive, negative, and neutral.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various parameters such as text and language of a tweet, the number of times it was retweeted, and the Twitter handle of the author.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that can process a receipt and output the total amount mentioned in it.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is one of the advanced fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
We challenge you to build a model that analyzes sentiments of a tweet and classifies them into positive, negative, and neutral.
