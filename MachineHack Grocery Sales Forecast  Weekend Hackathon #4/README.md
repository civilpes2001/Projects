## Problem
Sales forecasting has always been one of the most predominant applications of machine learning. Big companies like Walmart have been employing this technique to achieve steady and enormous growth over decades now. In this challenge, you as a data scientist must use machine learning to help a small grocery store in predicting its future sales and making better business decisions.

Given the daily sales of a grocery shop recorded over a period of almost 2 years, your objective as a data scientist is to build a machine learning model that can forecast the sales for the upcoming 3 months.

You are provided with the recorded observation of daily sales of a grocery shop over a period of 692 days to forecast the sales of the next 90 days.
