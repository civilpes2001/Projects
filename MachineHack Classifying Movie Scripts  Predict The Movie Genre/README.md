## Problem
Labeling text data can be hard. To use the available information to auto-create or predict the labels can be an interesting machine learning task. Using the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) the unstructured text data can be leveraged to auto-generate the right classes for the test data in the future.

In order to accomplish this, we have scraped close to 2000 movie scripts and the respective genres.

As some of the scripts are huge, it would be interesting to figure out new ways of feature extraction and different NLP techniques.

In this hackathon participants are challenged to use the movie script to design a Natural language processing system that can help the customer classify it into the right genre in the coming future.

The current platform struggles to classify the movies with an accuracy above 90%. However, we at MachineHack feel that the current state of the art NLP algorithms such as BERT and OpenGPT have paved the way to design more robust systems which can understand the context of the provided text data.

## Data Description
The unzipped folder will have the following files.

Train.csv – 1978 script file names with the class labels.
Test.csv – 849 script file names without the class labels.
Scripts – Folder with 2827 scripts .txt files.
Sample Submission – Sample format for the submission.
Started Notebook – A simple benchmark notebook
