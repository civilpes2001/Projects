## Problem statement

A leading global leader of e-commerce has over 150 million paid subscription users. One of the many perks of the subscription is the privilege of buying products at lower prices. For an upcoming sale, the organization has decided to promote local artisans and their products, to help them through these tough times. However, slashed prices may impact local artists.

To not let discounts affect local artists, the company has decided to determine the lowest price at which a particular good can be sold. Your task is to build a predictive model using Machine Learning that helps them set up a lowest-pricing model for these products.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various parameters such as a unique item ID, category of the market to which a product belongs, category and quality of the product, its demand rate, and its original market price.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models to predict the lowest price of a product.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of regression. Regression is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning.
We challenge you to build a predictive model that determines the lowest price at which a good can be sold on the day of sale.
