## Problem
As countries begin to ease their COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and restaurants re-open for delivery, delivery services such as Akeed are more relevant than ever to help these businesses stay afloat and enable people to enjoy their favourite foods again from the safety of their homes.

The objective of this competition is to build a recommendation engine to predict what restaurants customers are most likely to order from given the customer location, restaurant information, and the customer order history.

This solution will allow Akeed, an app-based food delivery service in Oman, to customise restaurant recommendations for each of their customers and ensure a more positive overall user experience.

This hackathon is the launch event for the Akeed Restaurant Recommendation Challenge, which will open on Monday 18 May.
