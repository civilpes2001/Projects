## Problem statement

Employees certainly are the most important asset of an organization. They are the ones working behind the scenes to ensure that your business functions seamlessly like a well-oiled machine. Hiring the best fit for an organization and ensuring that they stick with the company are two sides of the same coin. Employee attrition not only may lead to a minor hitch in the system, but it is also a major cost to the organization.

The Human Resources department of your organization is determined to predict the employee attrition rate in advance and put a corrective plan of action in place. As a Machine Learning Specialist, the HR team has requested you to build a sophisticated model that predicts the organizationâ€™s attrition rate.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various details such as gender and age of the employee, education and relationship status, pay scale, and other factors that may influence the attrition rate.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that can predict employee attrition rates.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of regression. Regression is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning.
We challenge you to build a model that computes the attrition rate for an employee working in an organization.
