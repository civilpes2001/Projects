## Problem statement

According to a CDC Report, over 2.4 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were reported in the United States of America in 2018. The report also highlighted a whopping 22% increase from 2017 to 2018 in the number of newborn deaths due to Syphilis.

In the light of upcoming World Health Day, we intend to raise awareness about various STDs and drugs used to cure them. 

A new pharmaceutical startup has recently been acquired by one of the world's largest MNCs. For the acquisition process, the startup is required to tabulate all drugs that have been sold and account for each drug's effectiveness. Your task is to develop a sophisticated NLP-based Machine Learning model to predict the base score of a certain drug in a provided case.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of certain parameters such as the drug's name, reviews by patients, popularity and use cases of the drug, and more. 

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that can predict the effectiveness of a certain drug to cure an STD
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
We challenge you to build a model that determines how effective an STD drug is in certain circumstances.
