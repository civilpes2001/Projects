## Overview
Weekend Hackathons are becoming more competitive, so we are back with a tougher one this time. In this weekend hackathon, we are providing an open UCI dataset but the target has been predicted by our machine learning model. The machinehackers are challenged to prove their mettle by designing a machine learning model to predict the popularity of a news article provided various statistics associated with the raw text data. Yes, you heard it right!

The provided dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. These articles were published by Mashable (www.mashable.com) and their content as the rights to reproduce it belongs to them. Hence, this dataset does not share the original content but some statistics associated with it. The provided features were extracted as it is done with any NLP use case. The goal is to predict the news article's popularity as close as possible. The noise in the extracted features makes it difficult to just use the provided attributes and reach a good score. This dataset also provides huge scope to feature engineering and we are looking forward to some serious competition this time.

## Dataset Description:

Train.csv - 7928 rows x 59 columns
Test.csv - 31716 rows x 58 columns
